# Pull Request Preparation Checklist

Before creating a PR, execute these steps:

1. Run linting: `prettier --write .`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Verify test coverage is above 80% (statements/branches/functions/lines) from the `npm test` coverage summary (enforced by `coverageReporter.check.global` in `karma.conf.js`). If any metric is below 80%, add/update specs until it clears before proceeding.
4. Review git diff: `git diff HEAD`
5. Stage changes: `git add .`
6. Create commit message following conventional commits:

    - `fix:` for bug fixes
    - `feat:` for new features
    - `docs:` for documentation
    - `refactor:` for code restructuring
    - `test:` for test additions
    - `chore:` for maintenance

    Do not add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any other Claude attribution line to the commit message.

7. Generate PR summary including:
    - What changed
    - Why it changed
    - Testing performed
    - Potential impacts
